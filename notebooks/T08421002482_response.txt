Q_TTSEM:Oui, il y a une mention d'un nombre de jours de télétravail limite dans le document 0. Le nombre de jours de télétravail ne peut pas être supérieur à 2 jours par semaine pour un temps plein.
Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents analyzed that answer the question are:

* "Article 3: Typology of telework The present agreement aims to regulate occasional telework, at the request of the employee for personal reasons. It in no way creates a regulation allowing for permanent telework, whether it be total or partial. The number of days of telework cannot be greater than 2 days per week for a full-time position."
* "Article 4: Access to telework 4-1 Modalities of access The implementation of telework requires a double acceptance, that of the employee and that of the manager. When making his first request, the employee must attest that the electrical installations of his home are in accordance with the regulations in force. He will also certify that his home has a space reserved for his professional activity. He will provide a "multirisk home" insurance policy covering his home for the exercise of telework."

My response after reasoning is:

* nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=2

My reasoning is:

* According to Article 3, the number of days of telework cannot be greater than 2 days per week for a full-time position. Therefore, the maximum number of days of telework per week is 2.
