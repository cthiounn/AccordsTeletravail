Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents are:

* "Les salariés à temps partiel ne travaillant pas 5 days per week cannot telework more than one day per week."
* "The telework is then formalized in the absence management software in order to ensure good follow-up."

My response after reasoning is:
nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=1

My reasoning is:
The first paragraph indicates that part-time workers who do not work 5 days a week can only telework one day a week. Therefore, the maximum number of days an employee can telework regularly per week is 1 day.
