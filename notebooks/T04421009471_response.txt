Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents are:

* "A compter du x, suite to the employee's request, it has been defined that the employee can perform his professional activity by teleworking one or half day, up to X days per week."
* "Three types of telework are distinguished, corresponding to the uses observed within the company: regular part-time telework (employee working remotely for a volume equivalent to a few days of their usual weekly work, each week); full-time regular telework (employee working remotely for a volume equivalent to all the days of their usual weekly work, each week); occasional telework (employee working remotely exceptionally)"

My response is:

* Ma r√©ponse: nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=X
* Mon raisonnement: The first paragraph indicates that the employee can telework up to X days per week. Therefore, the maximum number of days of telework per week is X.
