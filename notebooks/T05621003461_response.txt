Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents are:

* "Afin de préserver le lien social, la cohésion et le bon fonctionnement des équipes, le télétravail volontaire est limité à 20 days per year."
* "The EPCC determines the number of days teleworked per week and the proportion of work that can be carried out through telework."

My response is:

* nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=2

My reasoning is:

* The first paragraph indicates that the maximum number of days of telework per year is 20. Since there is no information about the distribution of these days over the weeks, I cannot directly answer the question about the maximum number of days of telework per week. However, since the total number of working days in a year is around 250 (5 days per week x 52 weeks), 20 days of telework per year represent approximately 8% of the total number of working days. Assuming a uniform distribution of these days over the weeks, this corresponds to 0.16 day of telework per week, i.e., around 0 or 1 day of telework per week. Therefore, I set the value of nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine to 2, which is the closest integer to 0.16.
