Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents analyzed that answer the question are:

* "Journ√©e(s) of telework desired in the week"
* "The employee can cumulate his days of telework on a month. The days of telework will be planned by the employee quarterly and subject to the validation of his manager without exceeding three days of telework per week."

My response after reasoning is:

* nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=3

My reasoning is:

* The first paragraph indicates that the number of days of telework per week is requested by the employee. However, this does not specify the maximum number of days authorized by the company.
* The second paragraph specifies that the employee can cumulate up to three days of telework per week. Therefore, the maximum number of days of telework per week is three.
