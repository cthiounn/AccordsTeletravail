Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two paragraphs relevant to the question from the documents are:

* "Journ√©e(s) of telework desired in the week"
* "The employee can cumulate his days of telework on a month. The days of telework will be planned by the employee quarterly and subject to the validation of his manager without exceeding three days of telework per week."

My response after reasoning is:
nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=3

My reasoning is:
The second paragraph states that the maximum number of telework days per week is three. Therefore, the value of nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine is 3.
