Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two paragraphes pertinent from the documents:

* "It will now be possible to work remotely for TWO days per week: 4 configurations will therefore be possible."
* "In order to preserve the social link with the company, cohesion and good functioning of the teams, telework is organized so that the full-time employee is present in the company at least 3 days per week."

My response after reasoning:
nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=2

My reasoning:
The first paragraph indicates that employees can work remotely for two days per week. This information is explicitly stated and concerns regular telework, not occasional or punctual telework. Therefore, I assign the value 2 to the variable 'nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine'. The second paragraph mentions the presence of full-time employees in the company for at least three days per week, but this does not provide information about the number of days of remote work, so it is not taken into account in the reasoning.
