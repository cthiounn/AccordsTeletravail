Q_TTSEM:Oui, il y a une mention d'un nombre de jours de télétravail maximum par semaine. Le salarié peut télétravailler au maximum 2 jours par semaine, sauf dérogation temporaire et justifiée.
Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents analyzed that answer the question:

* "Afin de maintenir suffisamment le lien social et fonctionnel avec la communauté de travail, the employee can telework a maximum of 2 days per week." ("T02921004527.txt")
* "The number of days and the days of telework are set, by mutual agreement between the employee and the manager, according to the organization of the structure and the activity of the employees in telework situation." ("T02921004527.txt")

My response after reasoning:
nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine = 2

My reasoning:
The first paragraph clearly states that the maximum number of days an employee can telework is two per week. The second paragraph does not provide a specific number but confirms that the number of days is determined by mutual agreement between the employee and the manager, with consideration for the organization of the structure and the activity of the employees in telework situation. However, since the first paragraph sets a maximum of two days per week, we can assume that this is the maximum number of days an employee can telework regularly, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I assign the value 2 to the variable 'nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine'.
