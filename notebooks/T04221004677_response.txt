Q_TTSEM_NOMBRE:Two relevant paragraphs from the documents are:

* "Le salarié doit être au minimum 2 days per week in face-to-face at the office (so 1 to 3 days of telework per week)"
* "The employee can change model during the year or number of teleworked days, and only at the beginning of the month, after consultation and agreement with his hierarchical manager."

My response is:
nombrejourdeteletravailmaxparsemaine=3

My reasoning is that the document states that the employee must be present at least 2 days a week in the office, which means that they can telework up to 3 days a week.
